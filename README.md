Hey there!
This is Harsha. 
<br>Just a small note before you start evaluating my project:
<br>I have uploaded each and every css font style and every image that I have taken from stock to build this website. You can feel free to ignore the folders of 'webfonts', 'css' and 'images' while evaluation. I have left the paragraphs with the default lorem text as it doesn't count into the evaluation of programming skills. I have also used a little bit of PHP which is purely uneccessary for creating a blog type website. I have just used it to powerup the forums that I have created in 'blog.html' and 'contact.html' files. Although I have used the php, it is not possible to receive responses unless it is hosted in a proper domain. So, I suggest you to ignore those 2 PHP files while evaluation.
<br>Hope You Understand!
<br>Thank You.
